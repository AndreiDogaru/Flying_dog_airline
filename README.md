# flying_dog_airline
First year final project KEA - Computer Science
  -> combination of java, javafx, css and mysql
  -> booking system for an imaginary airline
  -> the way it works: 
    ->staff member connects to the system
    -> searches for available flights for a passenger
    -> he logs in with the passenger credentials and books the flight for him
    -> staff member can also add new planes to the fleet and add flight schedules for any existing plane
  -> every plane, seat, flight schedule, employee and passenger is saved in the database
